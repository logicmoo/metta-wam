%!  spawn(:Goal) is det.
%
%   Executes a given `Goal` asynchronously in a background thread, using default options.
%
%   This predicate is a shorthand version of `spawn/2`, which runs the specified `Goal`
%   in a separate thread, allowing other tasks to proceed concurrently. By default, it
%   uses the `ephemeral` policy, which immediately starts execution of the `Goal` in the
%   background without waiting for a subsequent call to `await/1`.
%
%   This version is useful for simple cases where no specific options are required, and
%   default asynchronous behavior is desired.
%
%   @arg Goal The goal to be executed asynchronously. This should be any valid Prolog
%             goal that may succeed or fail independently of the main thread.
%
%   @example
%     % Execute a goal in a background thread without specifying options.
%     ?- spawn(sleep(2)).  % Will run in the background and finish after 2 seconds.
%
%     % If Goal unifies variables, they can be accessed after the async task completes.
%     ?- spawn(member(X, [a, b, c])), writeln(X).
%
%   @see spawn/2 for an option to specify additional settings like execution policies.
%
spawn(Goal) :-
    spawn(Goal, []).

%! spawn(:Goal, +Options) is det.
%
%   Seek solutions to `Goal` in a background thread. Solutions are
%   communicated to the calling thread by unifying free variables in
%   `Goal`. If `Goal` has no free variables, `async/3` must be used instead.
%   Options specified in `Options` are passed directly to `async/3`.
%
%   This predicate is designed to enable concurrent processing by allowing
%   `Goal` to run in parallel with the calling thread. Free variables in
%   `Goal` will be unified with solutions from the background thread as they
%   become available, allowing the calling thread to continue processing
%   asynchronously.
%
%   @arg Goal     The goal to be executed asynchronously. It may contain free
%                 variables, which are unified with solutions generated by `Goal`.
%   @arg Options  Options to control the execution policy, passed to `async/3`.
%
%   For example, the following code runs in about 1 second because both
%   `sleep/1` calls happen in parallel. When `foo/0` unifies `L`, it blocks
%   until `silly/1` has finished.
%
%       silly(L) :-
%           sleep(1),
%           L = [a,b].
%       foo :-
%           spawn(silly(L)),
%           sleep(1),
%           L = [A,B],  % blocks, if necessary
%           writeln(A-B).
%
%   If `Goal` produces multiple solutions, they can be iterated by
%   backtracking over the unification (e.g., `L = [A, B]` in the example above).
%   In case `Goal` fails or raises an exception, this outcome is observed
%   by the calling thread at the unification point.
%
%   @see async/3 for more fine-grained control when no free variables are present.
%
spawn(Goal, Options) :-
    term_variables(Goal, Vars),          % Collect free variables in Goal
    async_token(Goal, Token, Options),         % Start async execution with options
    Id is random(1<<63),                 % Generate a unique ID for this task
    assert(spawn_token_needs_await(Id)), % Register task as needing await
    make_opts(Options, Opts),            % Process options into Opts format
    maplist(spawn_freeze(Id, Token, Opts), Vars).  % Freeze variables until needed

%!  spawn_freeze(+Id, +Token, +Opts, +Var) is det.
%
%   Delays execution of `spawn_thaw/3` until `Var` is bound.
%
%   This predicate sets up `Var` with a `freeze/2` wrapper so that `spawn_thaw/3`
%   is executed only when `Var` becomes bound. This mechanism is used to defer
%   the processing of asynchronous tasks until needed.
%
%   @arg Id Unique identifier for the spawned task.
%   @arg Token Token associated with the spawned task, used for tracking.
%   @arg Opts Options record, containing the policy for async processing.
%   @arg Var The variable whose binding triggers the execution of `spawn_thaw/3`.
%
spawn_freeze(Id, Token, Opts, Var) :-
    freeze(Var, spawn_thaw(Id, Token, Opts)).

%! spawn_thaw(+Id, +Token, +Opts) is det.
%
%   Handles the thawing process when a frozen variable becomes bound,
%   proceeding with asynchronous task completion based on the options.
%
%   If the spawned task identified by `Id` still requires awaiting, `await/1` is
%   called on `Token` to block until the task is done. If the `lazy` policy is set
%   in `Opts`, `await/1` is called again to defer execution. If `await/1` has
%   already been called, it skips re-execution, indicated by a debug message.
%
%   @arg Id Unique identifier for the spawned task.
%   @arg Token Token associated with the spawned task.
%   @arg Opts Options record, specifying the task execution policy.
%
%   @example
%     % Example showing how spawn_thaw/3 coordinates task completion
%     % with the lazy policy.
%
%     % Suppose a goal like `compute_results/1` is spawned with `lazy`:
%     ?- spawn(compute_results(X), [policy(lazy)]).
%
%     % When `X` is later needed, `spawn_thaw/3` will handle the awaiting process.
%     % This ensures `compute_results/1` only executes when required by the calling
%     % thread.
%
spawn_thaw(Id, Token, Opts) :-
    ( retract(spawn_token_needs_await(Id)) ->
        % Await task completion if still pending
        debug(spawn, "Await on ~d", [Id]),
        await(Token)
    ; opts_policy(Opts, lazy) ->
        % Await again if the `lazy` policy is active
        debug(spawn, "Awaiting again on ~d", [Id]),
        await(Token)
    ; % Otherwise, task has already been awaited
        debug(spawn, "Already did await on ~d", [Id]),
        true
    ).

%!  lazy(+Goal) is det.
%
%   Postpone execution of `Goal` until it is actually needed. This predicate
%   behaves the same as `spawn/1` but uses the `lazy` policy, meaning that
%   `Goal` will only execute if required by the calling context.
%
%   Using `lazy/1` can be beneficial when `Goal` is resource-intensive or
%   time-consuming, especially if the result is only necessary in specific
%   code paths. This approach avoids duplicating complicated logic within
%   conditional branches and can serve as an alternative to defining an
%   additional, separate predicate.
%
%   @arg Goal The goal whose execution is deferred until needed.
%
%   @example
%     % Example of using lazy/1 in a conditional context:
%
%     foo(Xs) :-
%         % Defers the execution of `i_am_slow/3` until absolutely needed.
%         lazy(i_am_slow(a, B, [c(C), d(d), e(etc)])),
%
%         % Execution of `i_am_slow/3` depends on the following conditions:
%         ( day_of_week(tuesday) ->
%             append(B, C, Xs)
%         ; phase_of_moon(full) ->
%             append(C, B, Xs)
%         ; true ->
%             % `i_am_slow/3` is never executed in this code path
%             Xs = [hi]
%         ).
%
%   This example shows how `lazy/1` defers the execution of `i_am_slow/3`.
%   If neither `day_of_week(tuesday)` nor `phase_of_moon(full)` holds true,
%   the `lazy` policy prevents `i_am_slow/3` from executing at all, avoiding
%   unnecessary computation.
%
lazy(Goal) :-
    spawn(Goal, [policy(lazy)]).


%!  async_token(+Goal, -Token) is det.
%
%   Executes `Goal` asynchronously in a background thread, returning a `Token`
%   to track its status. This predicate is a shorthand for `async/3`, using
%   default options for execution.
%
%   The `Token` can be used with `await/1` to synchronize with the completion
%   of `Goal`. This allows the main thread to proceed with other tasks without
%   blocking, only retrieving results when necessary.
%
%   @arg Goal   The goal to be executed asynchronously. This can be any Prolog
%               goal, including those with free variables that unify upon completion.
%   @arg Token  A token that represents the asynchronous task, which can later
%               be used with `await/1` to wait for or query the result.
%
%   @example
%     % Run a goal asynchronously, retrieve its status using Token.
%     ?- async_token(some_heavy_task(X), Token),
%        % Other tasks can proceed here
%        await(Token),  % Wait for `some_heavy_task/1` to complete
%        writeln(X).
%
%   @see async/3 for specifying execution options.

%!  async_token(+Goal, -Token, +Options) is det.
%
%   Execute `Goal` in a background thread, using `Options` to control execution policy.
%   Returns a `Token` that can be used with `await/1` to synchronize with the task
%   completion. Free variables in `Goal` are unified with solutions found by the background
%   computation, allowing the calling thread to obtain results asynchronously.
%
%   Solutions to `Goal` are copied between threads, along with `Goal` itself, allowing
%   independent execution. Take care if large terms are involved, as copying may have
%   performance implications.
%
%   @arg Goal    The goal to be executed asynchronously. This can include free variables
%                that will unify upon the task’s completion.
%   @arg Token   A token representing the asynchronous task, which can later be passed
%                to `await/1` to retrieve results or wait for task completion.
%   @arg Options Execution options controlling task behavior.
%
%   Options are as follows:
%
%     * policy(Policy)
%       Specifies when and how `Goal` should execute. The `Policy` can be:
%       - `ephemeral` (default): Starts a new thread to execute `Goal` immediately.
%       - `lazy`: Defers execution of `Goal` until `await/1` is called, avoiding
%         creation of a background thread until the result is needed.
%
%   @example
%     % Example of executing a goal asynchronously with default (ephemeral) policy:
%     ?- async_token(some_computation(Result), Token, [policy(ephemeral)]),
%        % Do other work here
%        await(Token),  % Blocks until some_computation/1 completes
%        writeln(Result).
%
%     % Using the lazy policy to defer execution until needed:
%     ?- async_token(another_computation(Output), Token, [policy(lazy)]),
%        % other code executes without blocking
%        await(Token),  % Triggers execution of another_computation/1 only now
%        writeln(Output).

    async_policy(Policy, Goal, Token, Opts).  % Dispatch based on policy

%!  async_policy(+Policy, +Goal, -Token, +Opts) is det.
%
%   Determines the execution strategy for `Goal` based on `Policy`. For
%   `ephemeral`, `Goal` is executed in a new worker thread that seeks solutions.
%   For `lazy`, execution is deferred until `await/1` is invoked.
%
%   @arg Policy  Specifies whether the execution is `ephemeral` (immediate) or `lazy` (deferred).
%   @arg Goal    The goal to be executed. This goal may contain free variables to be unified upon task completion.
%   @arg Token   A token representing the task, used to manage or await the result.
%   @arg Opts    Additional options for the execution policy (currently unused).

%!  ephemeral_worker(+Work) is det.
%
%   Executes the `Goal` in `Work` within an ephemeral (temporary) worker thread.
%   This worker sends each solution, exceptions, or a final result to `SolutionsQ`.
%
%   If the goal has multiple solutions, each one is sent to `SolutionsQ` in sequence.

%!  await(+Token) is det.
%
%   Waits for solutions from an asynchronous call made with `async/3`. `Token`
%   is an opaque identifier provided by `async/3` that uniquely represents the

%
%   await/1 strives to have the same determinism as the original Goal

%   - If the goal succeeds with multiple solutions, `await/1` will yield each solution
%     on backtracking.
%   - If the goal fails, `await/1` also fails.
%   - If the goal raises an exception, `await/1` propagates the exception.
%
%   The `Token` indicates whether the computation is `ephemeral` (running in a background
