# Contributing to metta-wam

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the [metta-wam](https://github.com/trueagi-io/metta-wam) project!

## ðŸš© Where to Send Pull Requests

- **Default to `vnamed`**, our active development branch.
- If you believe your change is stable and production-ready:
  - You **may target `master`** instead.
  - But please first **check for conflicts with `vnamed`**.

If it turns out your change **conflicts between branches**, you might be kind enough to open **a pull request to each branch separately** â€” sorry if thatâ€™s ever a bit of a pain, but it helps us keep things clean and synced!

## ðŸ”§ How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**.
2. **Create a new branch** from `vnamed` or `master`, depending on your target.
3. **Make your changes**.
4. **Write clear, focused commit messages**.
5. **Push your branch** to your fork.
6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to the appropriate branch, describing your changes.

## âœ… Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] PR targets `vnamed` or `master` as appropriate
- [ ] Conflicts with `vnamed` are resolved or noted
- [ ] PR is scoped and easy to review
- [ ] Description clearly explains the intent

## ðŸ—£ Communication

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs or feature suggestions.
- For help or feedback, tag a maintainer (e.g., `@TeamSPoon`) in your PR or Issue.
